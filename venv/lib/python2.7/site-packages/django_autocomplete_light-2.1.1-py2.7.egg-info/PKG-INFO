        django-autocomplete-light's purpose is to enable autocompletes quickly and
        properly in a django project: it is the fruit of **years of R&D**. It was
        designed for Django so that every part overridable or reusable independently.
        It is stable, tested, documented and fully supported: it tries to be a good
        neighbour in Django ecosystem.
        
        Features
        --------
        
        Features include:
        
        - charfield, foreign key, many to many autocomplete widgets,
        - generic foreign key, generic many to many autocomplete widgets,
        - django template engine support for autocompletes, enabling you to include
          images etc ...
        - 100% overridable HTML, CSS, Python and Javascript: there is no variable
          hidden far down in the scope anywhere.
        - add-another popup supported outside the admin too.
        - keyboard is supported with enter, tab and arrows by default.
        - Django 1.8, Python3 support
        
        Each feature has a live example and is fully documented. It is also designed
        and documented so that you create your own awesome features too.
        
        Upgrade from 1.x.x
        ------------------
        
        **To upgrade to v2**, please enjoy the `v1 to v2 upgrade instructions
        <http://django-autocomplete-light.readthedocs.org/en/stable-2.x.x/1to2.html>`_
        (documented with love !).
        
        - the Autocomplete class design hasn't changed at all.
        - ``yourlabsWidget()`` doesn't parses ``data-*`` options the same,
        - the django/form python code has been re-organised ie.
          ``get_widgets_dict()`` is gone and ``autocomplete_light.ModelForm``
          wraps around all features by default.
        - use ``autocomplete_light.ModelForm`` instead of
          ``autocomplete_light.GenericModelForm`` - generic foreign keys and
          django-generic-m2m are supported by default if installed.
